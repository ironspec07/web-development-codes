    <h1>Welcome to My Website.</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my Website! My name is Aditya, and I am a third year B.Tech student currently pursuing my degree in computer science engineering from Vellore institute of technology, Bhopal.

        I have always been passionate about programming, and I am currently honing my skills in Java programming, full-stack development, and Android app development. As a Java programmer, I am proficient in writing well-structured and efficient code that meets the highest industry standards. I am also experienced in developing full-stack applications, which involve working with both front-end and back-end technologies to create robust and scalable web applications.
        
        In addition to my expertise in Java and full-stack development, I have also been actively developing Android applications. I have a strong understanding of the Android development environment, and I am well-versed in developing applications that are optimized for the Android platform.
        
        During my time in college, I have also been involved in various extracurricular activities, such as Cricket and Hackathons, which have allowed me to develop my leadership and communication skills. I am always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges, and I am excited to see where my career in technology will take me.
